   Void is a module for memory buffer manipulation that provides:
   
   * Proxy userdata(views) that point to slices of underlying buffers.
   * Buffers up to 2GB that can be accessed as signed or unsigned types.
   * Named shared queues that allow cross thread transfer of buffers.
   * Common operations like writing to/reading from files and sockets.
